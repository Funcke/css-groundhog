## Introduction

The Groundhog buttongroup joins buttons, which are contextually connected. Most of the time they can function like tabs, where only one can be active. 

## Create a buttongroup

To create a buttongroup, create a wrapping element around the buttons you want to wrap. Give the wrapping element the attribute `class="buttongroup"` to enable the buttongroup styling. 

Buttons within a buttongroup can be marked as active by adding the class `is-active` to the link / button element.
