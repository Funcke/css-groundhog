## Get Groundhog

You can simply [download Groundhog CSS and JS files](/download/groundhog-v{{sitedata.package.version}}.zip) and include them into your pages.

To use the files put the CSS into the `<head>` of your page like this:
```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="main.css" />
```

And include the JS at the end of the `<body>` tag of your page:

```html
<body>
... all your content

<script type="text/javascript" src="main.js"></script>
</body>
```
